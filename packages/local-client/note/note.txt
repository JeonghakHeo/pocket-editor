When building, ESBuild generates js file and css file.
ESBuild doesn't have a filesystem to work with(we are working on a browser), it is not able to load up the css that we import(or the path to load the css).

Later there will be multiple Preview compoments. They will need to use the bundling logic 

L.158
When dragging, if mouse goes over to iframe, it loses event(or communication) because the event is sent into the iframe as opposed to the top level document. 
To solve this, we can add html element on top of(or over) iframe and that html element will receive the event as opposed to into the iframe

When dragging, on body element react-draggable-transparent-selection class get applied. With that, we can add pesudo after class and this pesudo class sits on top of iframe so it doesn't block the event

Section 14
async error invalid code error 
Caught, Uncaught error in/outside of try catch 
error event default behavior
runtime error, compilation error


Section 19 L.248
createBundle in useEffect dependency array in code-cell.
affected causing flashing issue on preview. it was due to the bound action. 
every time when the code-cell is re-rendered, it created a new version of the bound action. fixed by memoizing the action to cache.
